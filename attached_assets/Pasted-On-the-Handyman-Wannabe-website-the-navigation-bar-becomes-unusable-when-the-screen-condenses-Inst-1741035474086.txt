On the Handyman Wannabe website, the navigation bar becomes unusable when the screen condenses. Instead of implementing a hamburger menu, apply the following adaptive solutions to maintain usability across all screen sizes.

1. Convert to a Horizontal Scrollable Navigation Bar on Smaller Screens
When the screen width is below 1024px, adjust the navigation bar to a horizontal scroll layout instead of collapsing it.
Allow users to swipe left/right or scroll horizontally to access all menu options.
Add left and right arrow buttons (on either side of the nav bar) for users who prefer to click rather than swipe.
2. Enable Multi-Column Layout for the Services Menu
Instead of a long single-column list, break the services menu into two or three columns when the screen shrinks.
This ensures the navigation remains compact but readable without taking up excessive vertical space.
3. Prioritize Important Links & Collapse Less Essential Items
Display high-priority categories (e.g., Electrical, Plumbing, Flooring) upfront.
Move less frequently used links (e.g., Furniture Assembly, Holiday Lighting) into a “More” dropdown that expands when clicked.
4. Make the Navigation Section Sticky with Overflow Handling
Ensure the navigation bar remains sticky at the top of the screen so users can always access it.
Implement an adaptive font size that adjusts dynamically to fit more text in smaller spaces.
Prevent text wrapping issues by using ellipsis truncation ("...") where necessary.
5. Ensure Full Clickability & Touch Optimization
Fix any touch input issues that make selecting menu items difficult on mobile and tablet devices.
Increase the touch target size of each menu item for better usability.
6. Test & Validate on Multiple Screen Sizes
Ensure smooth functionality on mobile devices, tablets, and smaller laptop screens.
Test in Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge to confirm consistency across browsers.
Expected Outcome:
After implementing these changes, the navigation bar will remain fully functional across all screen sizes, allowing users to access all menu items without frustration or usability issues.
