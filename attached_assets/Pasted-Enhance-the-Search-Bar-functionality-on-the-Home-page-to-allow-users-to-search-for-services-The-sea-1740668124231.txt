Enhance the Search Bar functionality on the Home page to allow users to search for services. The search should filter through the "name" key in services.json. When a user selects a service from the search results, they should be redirected to the Service Directory page, and the corresponding service’s popup modal should automatically appear.

Additionally, ensure that the Search Bar dropdown appears above the "Hero-to-Body" border, making the dropdown fully visible when displaying results.

Implementation Requirements:
✅ Autocomplete Search Bar Functionality:

Implement an autocomplete feature that dynamically suggests services based on the "name" key in services.json.
Ensure real-time filtering as the user types to display the most relevant results.
✅ Dropdown Positioning & UI Fix:

Modify z-index and positioning styles to ensure that the Search Bar dropdown appears above the "Hero-to-Body" border.
Prevent clipping issues by using absolute positioning and ensuring the dropdown is fully visible across all screen sizes.
✅ Service Selection & Redirection:

When a user selects a service, redirect them to the Service Directory page.
Store the selected service's ID as a query parameter in the URL (e.g., ?service=smart-lighting-electrical-02).
✅ Trigger Popup Modal on Service Directory Page:

On page load, check for the service query parameter in the URL.
If a service ID is present, automatically trigger the popup modal for that service.
The modal should dynamically fetch service details using the matching "id" key from services.json.
✅ Ensure Smooth User Experience:

Add loading states to prevent delays during redirection.
Maintain mobile responsiveness for seamless functionality across devices.
Expected Outcome:
Users can search for a service by its name on the Home page, select a result, and be redirected to the Service Directory page, where the corresponding service popup will automatically open.

Additionally, the Search Bar dropdown will appear above the "Hero-to-Body" border, ensuring better visibility and usability across all devices
